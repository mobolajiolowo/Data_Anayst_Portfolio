-[Pizza Place Dashboard](https://github.com/mobolajiolowo/Data_Anayst_Portfolio/tree/main/PowerBi/Pizza_Place_Sales)
This project was done using Microsoft Powerbi. The data was gotten from maven analytics as csv files and imported into Microsoft PowerBi. The mdelling was then done after which the data was thoruoghly analysed. This was done by cleaning the data, removing and creating new columns as needed. New measures were also created for the visualization, after which the final stage of Data visualization was done.
